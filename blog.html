          <h2>Pursed Lip Breathing For When You Are Stressed</h2>
          <div class="post-meta muted small">

            Several breathing techniques could help you feel calmer and more
            relaxed if you’re dealing with high levels of stress. All you need
            is a quiet space where you can pay attention to your breathing.
          </p>
          <p>
            This simple breathing technique helps to slow down your breathing
            pace by having you apply deliberate effort in each breath.You can
            practice pursed lip breathing at any time. It may be especially
            useful during activities such as bending, lifting, or stair
            climbing.
          </p>
          <p>To do it:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Relax your neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li>
              Keeping your mouth closed, inhale slowly through your nose for 2
              counts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pucker or purse your lips as though you were going to whistle.
            </li>
            <li>
              Exhale slowly by blowing air through your pursed lips for a count
              of 4.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Daily Mantras To Tell Yourself</h2>
          <div class="post-meta muted small">
            <p>12-05-2025 | 5 min read</p>

          <p>
            Words hold a lot of meaning, so imagine the power of saying
            something motivating to yourself each and every day. A great mantra
            should incite a feeling inside you, a feeling that you don’t quite
            feel in your soul yet but you want to, a feeling of empowerment. If
            it does that, then adopt it for the next 7 days, repeat it 20 times
            each morning with heart and soul, and after one week, evaluate how
            you feel.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of the day, a mantra - or a phrase that you repeat
            frequently - is a very simple tool that helps with
            self-transformations, and in these instances below, they can train
            your mind to think more positively:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>I am worthy just as I am.</li>
            <li>I am centred and at peace.</li>
            <li>I have enough, I do enough, I am enough.</li>
            <li>I am grateful for all that I have.</li>
            <li>I am strong and capable.</li>
            <li>Today, above all else, I choose love.</li>
          </ol>
